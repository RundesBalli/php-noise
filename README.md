# :milky_way: php-noise
A script for generating (random) noise background images.

## :wrench: Requirements
`php-gd` is required for this script to work.  
You can install it with:  
```
sudo apt install php-gd
```

## :computer: Platform
You can either use this script via CLI or in the Browser.  
The Browser script has several high-caps to prevent too big values.  

### :clipboard: Parameters
`$ php noise.php --help` and `$ php noise.php -h`, and `./noise.php?help` in the browser will show all possible parameters.  
All parameters are optional. A script call in the browser requires passing parameters via GET.

```
-h, --help
	Shows this help text and exits the script.
-r <value>, -g <value>, -b <value>
	Red, green, blue
	Possible values: 0-255
	If one of the parameters is invalid or not provided, it will be generated randomly.
--tiles <value>
	Number of tiles per row and column.
	The image is square, therefore it hast $tiles x $tiles tiles.
	Default: 50
	In CLI this value isn't capped. Outside of the CLI its capped to 50.
--tileSize <value>
	Width and height of one tile in pixels.
	Default: 7
	In CLI this value isn't capped. Outside of the CLI its capped to 20.
--borderWidth <value>
